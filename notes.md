[client] == HTTP(requests, responses) === [api]

HTTP

-http methods (GET, POST...)
-http message
  -header

[client] makes a request to the [server/api]

From React you were making requests with axios

[server/api] sends a response to the [client]

Our api sees the requests and produces a response
